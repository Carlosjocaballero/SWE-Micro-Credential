    <p>The building of Akershus Castle and Fortress was commenced in 1299 under king HÃ¥kon V. The medieval castle, which was completed in the 1300s, had a strategic location at the very end of the headland, and withstood a number of sieges throughout the ages. King Christian IV (1588-1648) had the castle modernised and converted into a Renaissance castle and royal residence.</p>
    <p>The Akershus fortress has the status of a national symbol because of its role as seat of the king and government and the many important and dramatic historical events that have taken place here. The national importance is underlined by the fact that the castle now used as government's premier entertainment venues and hosts the Royal Mausoleum.</p><br>
